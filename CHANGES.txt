WTForms Changelog
=================

Version 0.4
-----------
Not yet released.

- Widget support: Fields now use widgets for rendering.

Version 0.3.1
-------------
Released January 24th, 2009.

- Several fixes were made to the code and tests to make WTForms compatible
  with Python 2.3/2.4.

- Form's properties can now be accessed via dictionary-style access such as
  `form['author']`. This also has the intended effect of making variable
  lookups in Django templates more reliable.

- Form and Field construction changes: Form now uses a metaclass to handle
  creating its `_unbound_fields` property, and Field construction now gives an
  instance of the new `UnboundField` class instead of using a partial function
  application.  These are both internal changes and do not change the API.

Version 0.3
-----------
Released January 18th, 2009.

- Validation overhaul: Fields are now responsible for their own validation,
  instead of mostly relying on Form. There are also new pre_validate and
  post_validate hooks on subfields, adding a great deal of flexibility when
  dealing with field-level validation. Note that this is an API breaking change
  if you have any subfields that override `Field.validate`. These will need to
  be updated to use the new hooks.
 
- Changes in how `process_data` and `process_formdata` are called: 
    * `process_data` no longer accepts the `has_formdata` parameter.
    * At form instantiation time, `process_data` will be called only once for
      each field. If a model object is provided which contains the property,
      then this value is used. Otherwise, a keyword argument if specified is 
      used. Failing that, the field's default value is used.
    * If any form data is sent, `process_formdata` will be called after
      `process_data` for each field.  If no form data is available for the
      given field, it is called with an empty list.

- wtforms.ext.django has been overhauled, both to mirror features and changes
  of the Django 1.0 release, and to add some useful fields for working with
  django ORM data in forms.
 
- the `checker` keyword argument to SelectField, SelectMultipleField, and 
  RadioField has been renamed to `coerce` to reflect the actual functionality
  of this callable.


Version 0.2
-----------
Released January 13th, 2009.

- We have documentation and unit tests!

- Fields now have a `flags` property which contain boolean flags that are set
  either by the field itself or validators being specified on a field. The
  flags can then be used in checks in template or python code.

- Changed the way fields take parameters, they are no longer quasi magic. This
  is a breaking change. Please see the documentation for the new syntax.

- Added optional description argument to Field, accessible on the field as
  `description`. This provides an easy way to define e.g. help text in the same
  place as the form.

- Added new semantics for validators which can stop the validation chain, with
  or without errors.

- Added a regexp validator, and removed the not_empty validator in favour of
  two validators, optional and required. The new validators allow control
  over the validation chain in addition to checking emptiness.

- Renamed wtforms.contrib to wtforms.ext and reorganised wtforms.ext.django.
  This is a breaking change if you were using the django extensions, but should
  only require changing your imports around a little.

- Better support for other frameworks such as Pylons.
