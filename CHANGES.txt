Version 0.6
-----------

- Fields:
  * Field._default is now Field.default.
  * All fields now have a `raw_data` property.
  * Fields which are select fields (including those in .ext) can be
    iterated to produce options, and have an option_widget kwarg.

    QuerySelectField to address behavioral consistency.
  * Added FloatField, based on IntegerField.

- Extensions:
  * ext.appengine now supports FloatProperty and GeoPtProperty.
  * ext.sqlalchemy QueryMultipleSelectField changed to QuerySelectMultipleField.


Version 0.5
-----------
Released February 13th, 2010.

- Added a BaseForm class which provides the core processing and validation
  functionality of Form without requiring declarative subclassing.

- Fields:
  * Field labels now default to a humanized field name.
  * Fields now have a `short_name` property which is the un-prefixed name.
  * DecimalField now rounds values for display without float coercion.
    See docs for details on how to format decimals.

    all fields can now support multiple-column primary keys.
  * ext.sqlalchemy.orm contains tools for making forms from ORM models.

  * Added ext.appengine contributed by Rodrigo Moraes.

- Added AnyOf and NoneOf validators.


Version 0.4
-----------
Released October 10th, 2009.

- Fields have much greater control over input processing. Filters have been
  added to implement a simple way to transform input data.

- Added fields that encapsulate advanced data structures such as dynamic lists
  or child forms for more powerful field composing.

- Fields now use widgets for rendering.

- All built-in validators have been converted to classes to clean up the code.

- `Form.auto_populate` and `Field.populate` were renamed to `populate_obj` to
  clarify that they populate another object, not the Form or Field. This is an
  API breaking change.

- Dropped support for Python 2.3.


Version 0.3.1
-------------
Released January 24th, 2009.

- Several fixes were made to the code and tests to make WTForms compatible
  with Python 2.3/2.4.

- Form's properties can now be accessed via dictionary-style access such as
  `form['author']`. This also has the intended effect of making variable
  lookups in Django templates more reliable.

- Form and Field construction changes: Form now uses a metaclass to handle
  creating its `_unbound_fields` property, and Field construction now gives an
  instance of the new `UnboundField` class instead of using a partial function
  application. These are both internal changes and do not change the API.


Version 0.3
-----------
Released January 18th, 2009.

- Validation overhaul: Fields are now responsible for their own validation,
  instead of mostly relying on Form. There are also new pre_validate and
  post_validate hooks on subfields, adding a great deal of flexibility when
  dealing with field-level validation. Note that this is an API breaking change
  if you have any subfields that override `Field.validate`. These will need to
  be updated to use the new hooks.

- Changes in how `process_data` and `process_formdata` are called:
    * `process_data` no longer accepts the `has_formdata` parameter.
    * At form instantiation time, `process_data` will be called only once for
      each field. If a model object is provided which contains the property,
      then this value is used. Otherwise, a keyword argument if specified is
      used. Failing that, the field's default value is used.
    * If any form data is sent, `process_formdata` will be called after
      `process_data` for each field. If no form data is available for the
      given field, it is called with an empty list.

- wtforms.ext.django has been overhauled, both to mirror features and changes
  of the Django 1.0 release, and to add some useful fields for working with
  django ORM data in forms.

- The `checker` keyword argument to SelectField, SelectMultipleField, and
  RadioField has been renamed to `coerce` to reflect the actual functionality
  of this callable.


Version 0.2
-----------
Released January 13th, 2009.

- We have documentation and unit tests!

- Fields now have a `flags` property which contain boolean flags that are set
  either by the field itself or validators being specified on a field. The
  flags can then be used in checks in template or python code.

- Changed the way fields take parameters, they are no longer quasi magic. This
  is a breaking change. Please see the documentation for the new syntax.

- Added optional description argument to Field, accessible on the field as
  `description`. This provides an easy way to define e.g. help text in the same
  place as the form.

- Added new semantics for validators which can stop the validation chain, with
  or without errors.

- Added a regexp validator, and removed the not_empty validator in favour of
  two validators, optional and required. The new validators allow control
  over the validation chain in addition to checking emptiness.

- Renamed wtforms.contrib to wtforms.ext and reorganised wtforms.ext.django.
  This is a breaking change if you were using the django extensions, but should
  only require changing your imports around a little.

- Better support for other frameworks such as Pylons.


Version 0.1
-----------
Released July 25th, 2008.

- Initial release.
