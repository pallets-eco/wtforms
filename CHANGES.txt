WTForms Changelog
=================

Version 0.2.1
-------------
Not yet released.

- wtforms.ext.django has been overhauled, both to mirror features and changes
  of the Django 1.0 release, and to add some useful fields for working with
  django ORM data in forms.


Version 0.2
-----------
Released January 13th, 2009.

- We have documentation and unit tests!

- Fields now have a `flags` property which contain boolean flags that are set
  either by the field itself or validators being specified on a field. The
  flags can then be used in checks in template or python code.

- Changed the way fields take parameters, they are no longer quasi magic. This
  is a breaking change. Please see the documentation for the new syntax.

- Added optional description argument to Field, accessible on the field as
  `description`. This provides an easy way to define e.g. help text in the same
  place as the form.

- Added new semantics for validators which can stop the validation chain, with
  or without errors.

- Added a regexp validator, and removed the not_empty validator in favour of
  two validators, optional and required. The new validators allow control
  over the validation chain in addition to checking emptiness.

- Renamed wtforms.contrib to wtforms.ext and reorganised wtforms.ext.django.
  This is a breaking change if you were using the django extensions, but should
  only require changing your imports around a little.

- Better support for other frameworks such as Pylons.

Version 0.1
-----------
Released July 25th, 2008.

- Initial release.
