CSRF Protection
===============

.. module:: wtforms.csrf

The CSRF package includes tools that help you implement checking against
cross-site request forgery ("csrf"). Due to the large number of variations on
approaches people take to CSRF (and the fact that many make compromises) the
base implementation allows you to plug in a number of CSRF validation
approaches.

CSRF implementations are made by subclassing
:class:`~wtforms.csrf.core.CSRF`. For utility, we have provided one
possible CSRF implementation in the package that can be used with many
frameworks for session-based hash secure keying,
:class:`~wtforms.csrf.session.SessionCSRF`.

Using CSRF
----------

CSRF in WTForms 2.0 is now driven through a number of variables on
:mod:`class Meta <wtforms.meta>`. After choosing a CSRF implementation,
import it and configure it on the class Meta of a subclass of Form
like such::

    from somemodule import SomeCSRF

    class MyBaseForm(Form):
        class Meta:
            csrf = True  # Enable CSRF
            csrf_class = SomeCSRF  # Set the CSRF implementation
            csrf_secret = b'foobar'  # Some implementations need a secret key.
            # Any other CSRF settings here.

And once you've got this set up, you can define your forms as a subclass
of `MyBaseForm`:

.. code-block:: python

    class UserForm(MyBaseForm):
        name = StringField()
        age = IntegerField()

    def view():
        form = UserForm(request.POST)
        if request.POST and form.validate():
            pass # Form is valid and CSRF succeeded

        return render('user.html', form=form)

There is a special field inside the CSRF form (called ``csrf_token`` by
default) which you need to make sure you render in your template:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <form action="/user" method="POST">
    {{ form.csrf_token }}
    {% if form.csrf_token.errors %}
        <div class="warning">You have submitted an invalid CSRF token</div>
    {% endif %}
    <div>{{ form.name }} {{ form.name.label }}</div>
    <div>{{ form.age }}{{ form.age.label }}</div>

Remember, with the `class Meta` you can always override variables in a sub-class
or at the constructor for special-cases::

    class SearchForm(MyBaseForm):
        """
        We expect search queries to come externally, thus we don't want CSRF
        even though it's set up on the base form.
        """
        class Meta:
            # This overrides the value from the base form.
            csrf = False


How WTForms CSRF works
----------------------

Most CSRF implementations hinge around creating a special token, which is put in
a hidden field on the form named `csrf_token`, which must be rendered in your
template to be passed from the browser back to your view. There are many
different methods of generating this token, but they are usually the result of
a cryptographic hash function against some data which would be hard to forge.

.. module:: wtforms.csrf.core

.. autoclass:: CSRFTokenField

    .. automethod:: __init__

    .. autoattribute:: current_token

    .. automethod:: _value

    .. automethod:: populate_obj

    .. automethod:: pre_validate

    .. automethod:: process

.. autoclass:: CSRF

    .. automethod:: setup_form

    .. automethod:: generate_csrf_token

    .. automethod:: validate_csrf_token

    .. autoattribute:: field_class

        The class of the token field we're going to construct. Can be
        overridden in subclasses if need be.


Creating your own CSRF implementation
-------------------------------------

Here we will sketch out a simple theoretical CSRF implementation which
generates a hash token based on the user's IP.

**Note** This is a simplistic example meant to illustrate creating a CSRF
implementation. This isn't recommended to be used in production because the
token is deterministic and non-changing per-IP, which means this isn't the
most secure implementation of CSRF.

First, let's create our CSRF class::

    from wtforms.csrf.core import CSRF
    from hashlib import md5

    SECRET_KEY = '1234567890'

    class IPAddressCSRF(CSRF):
        """
        Generate a CSRF token based on the user's IP. I am probably not very
        secure, so don't use me.
        """
        def setup_form(self, form):
            self.csrf_context = form.meta.csrf_context
            return super(IPAddressCSRF, self).setup_form(form)

        def generate_csrf_token(self, csrf_token):
            token = md5(SECRET_KEY + self.csrf_context).hexdigest()
            return token

        def validate_csrf_token(self, form, field):
            if field.data != field.current_token:
                raise ValueError('Invalid CSRF')


Now that we have this taken care of, let's write a simple form and view which would implement this::

    class RegistrationForm(Form):
        class Meta:
            csrf = True
            csrf_class = IPAddressCSRF

        name = StringField('Your Name')
        email = StringField('Email', [validators.email()])

    def register(request):
        form = RegistrationForm(
            request.POST,
            meta={'csrf_context': request.ip}
        )

        if request.method == 'POST' and form.validate():
            pass # We're all good, create a user or whatever it is you do
        elif form.csrf_token.errors:
            pass # If we're here we suspect the user of cross-site request forgery
        else:
            pass # Any other errors

        return render('register.html', form=form)

And finally, a simple template:

.. code-block:: html+jinja

    <form action="register" method="POST">
        {{ form.csrf_token }}
        <p>{{ form.name.label }}: {{ form.name }}</p>
        <p>{{ form.email.label }}: {{ form.email }}</p>
        <input type="submit" value="Register">
    </form>


Please note that implementing CSRF detection is not fool-proof, and even with
the best CSRF protection implementation, it's possible for requests to be
forged by expert attackers. However, a good CSRF protection would make it
infeasible for someone from an external site to hijack a form submission from
another user and perform actions as them without additional a priori knowledge.

In addition, it's important to understand that very often, the more strict the
CSRF protection, the higher the chance of false positives occurring (ie,
legitimate users getting blocked by your CSRF protection) and choosing a CSRF
implementation is actually a matter of compromise. We will attempt to provide a
handful of usable reference algorithms built in to this library in the future, to
allow that choice to be easy.

Some tips on criteria people often examine when evaluating CSRF implementations:

 * **Reproducability** If a token is based on attributes about the user, it
   gains the advantage that one does not need secondary storage in which to
   store the value between requests. However, if the same attributes can be
   reproduced by an attacker, then the attacker can potentially forge this
   information.

 * **Reusability**. It might be desired to make a completely different token
   every use, and disallow users from re-using past tokens. This is an
   extremely powerful protection, but can have consequences on if the user uses
   the back button (or in some cases runs forms simultaneously in multiple
   browser tabs) and submits an old token, or otherwise. A possible compromise
   is to allow reusability in a time window (more on that later).

 * **Time Ranges** Many CSRF approaches use time-based expiry to make sure that
   a token cannot be (re)used beyond a certain point. Care must be taken in
   choosing the time criteria for this to not lock out legitimate users. For
   example, if a user might walk away while filling out a long-ish form, or to
   go look for their credit card, the time for expiry should take that into
   consideration to provide a balance between security and limiting user
   inconvenience.

 * **Requirements** Some CSRF-prevention methods require the use of browser
   cookies, and some even require client-side scripting support. The webmaster
   implementing the CSRF needs to consider that such requirements (though
   effective) may lock certain legitimate users out, and make this
   determination whether it is a good idea to use. For example, for a site
   already using cookies for login, adding another for CSRF isn't as big of a
   deal, but for other sites it may not be feasible.


Session-based CSRF implementation
---------------------------------

.. automodule:: wtforms.csrf.session

.. autoclass:: SessionCSRF

    **Meta Values**

    * ``csrf_secret`` A byte string which is the master key by which we encode
      all values. Set to a sufficiently long string of characters that is
      difficult to guess or bruteforce (recommended at least 16 characters)
      for example the output of ``os.urandom(16)``.

    * ``csrf_time_limit`` if `None`, tokens last forever (not recommended.)
      Otherwise, set to a ``datetime.timedelta`` that will define how long
      CSRF tokens are valid for. Defaults to 30 minutes.

    * ``csrf_context`` This should be a ``request.session``-style object.
      Usually given in the Form constructor.


Example
~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    from wtforms.csrf.session import SessionCSRF
    from datetime import timedelta

    class MyBaseForm(Form):
        class Meta:
            csrf = True
            csrf_class = SessionCSRF
            csrf_secret = b'EPj00jpfj8Gx1SjnyLxwBBSQfnQ9DJYe0Ym'
            csrf_time_limit = timedelta(minutes=20)

    class Registration(MyBaseForm):
        name = StringField()

    def view(request):
        form = Registration(request.POST, meta={'csrf_context': request.session})
        # rest of view here

Note that request.session is passed as the ``csrf_context`` override to the
meta info, this is so that the CSRF token can be stored in your session for
comparison on a later request.


Example Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WTForms primitives are designed to work with a large variety of frameworks, and
as such sometimes things seem like they are more work to use, but with some
smart integration, you can actually clean up your code substantially.

For example, if you were going to integrate with `Flask`_, and wanted to use
the SessionCSRF implementation, here's one way to get the CSRF context to be
available without passing it all the time:

.. code-block:: python

    from flask import session
    from wtforms.csrf.session import SessionCSRF

    class MyBaseForm(Form):
        class Meta:
            csrf = True
            csrf_class = SessionCSRF
            csrf_secret = app.config['CSRF_SECRET_KEY']

            @property
            def csrf_context(self):
                return session

Now with any subclasses of MyBaseForm, you don't need to pass in the csrf
context, and on top of that, we grab the secret key out of your normal app
configuration.
